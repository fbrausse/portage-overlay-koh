		This package provides a version of Prelude where
		unary and binary operations such as @not@, @+@, @==@
		have their result type derived from the parameter type(s)
		and thus supports mixed-type arithmetic and comparisons.
		
		Partial operations such as division, sqrt and power
		do not throw exceptions even when errors such as division by zero
		occur.  Instead, these errors are propagated bottom-up in
		a bespoke error-accumulating functor.
		
		This library is a by-product of developing the
		&lt;https://github.com/michalkonecny/aern2 AERN2&gt; library for interval and exact real computation.
		Certain aspects are specifically tailored for interval or exact real arithmetics,
		including three-valued numerical comparisons
		and distinguishing potential and certain errors.
		
		See module &quot;MixedTypesNumPrelude&quot; for further documentation.
		
		/Ghci 8.0.* fails when loading this package/ due to ghc bug &lt;https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/13385#ticket 13385&gt;.
		This bug does not affect ghci 7.10.3 and ghci 8.2.* and above.
